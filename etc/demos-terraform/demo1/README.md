# demo1

Code for "Continuously delivering infrastructure using Terraform" training.

This is just a basic Terraform example.

## Commands:

1. terraform init
1. terraform plan
1. terraform apply

## Notes:

* Environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` should be set before running code in `terraform` directory.
* `terraform.tfstate` file is ignored by `.gitignore`, so be careful when running this example from different places as you may see errors.
