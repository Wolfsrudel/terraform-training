# Terraform Basics training

This repository contains code for the "Terraform Basics" training.

[Send me an me](mailto:anton@antonbabenko.com) if you are looking for Terraform trainer or mentor.

Terraform tasks are inside directory `terraform`. Solutions are inside `solutions`.

## Preparations

* Install latest stable version of [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/intro/getting-started/install.html) and [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html)
* Generate temporary SSH key locally ([read more](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/#generating-a-new-ssh-key))
* Mac, Linux or Windows - all is fine as long as you can use it. If you want, you can get Linux box running using [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) with [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and install software from above on it. This is optional.
* Environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` should be set before running Terraform code.
